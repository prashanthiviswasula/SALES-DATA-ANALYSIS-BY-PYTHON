# SALES-DATA-ANALYSIS-BY-PYTHON
To analyse Diwali sales data improve customer experience and sales 
I used different libraries like Numpy,Pandas,MATPLOTLIB,Seaborn and I have imported csv file whih has values. Company gave us the data of their  DIWALI sale and they wanted me to analyse the data and share a summary by which they can 
*Improve customer experience by analyzing sales data 
*Increase Revenue 

FIRSTLY, I cleaned the data by removing null and duplicate values and renaming the columns. 
NEXT, I did exploratory Data Analysis on columns like gender,age,state,marital status.
THIRDLY, i use different functions and charts  to visualize the data and to represent the data in columns like occupation,product category
and gave my summary
